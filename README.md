# Covid-response-policies-in-S-o-Paulo-Brazil
In this repository I share the databases and scripts in R for analyzing pandemic response policies in the city of São Paulo and in Brazil.


This is part of my data analysis for my master's thesis. The research entitled “Lockdown in motion: from the diffusion of best practices to community strategies” analyzes the data, among other databases, of the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), which I explore in this repository.

I am making available here the csv. files I am using, which I have modified from the original version, and the R scripts I am building for the data visualizations.
